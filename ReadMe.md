# Project introduction

its gonna be an educational website about extinct and critically endangered animals.
the idea is a competetitive trivia game with a leaderboard for correct answers.

# Implementation

I am gonna implement this with a MERN stack to test my skills and because I get excited about exotic and rare animals. also love trivia.. trivia is **love**.

idea about roles, I want roles to reflect the user's interest in wildlife. so for example one would aquire the role of
marine if you like solving questions and learning about the ocean fauna whereas someone else's role whose interested more in
reptiles would be different. **TO BE DECIDED**
